Big Menu
======================

Big Menu provides an alternative to core menu management. It adds scalability to the admin menu management screen, by loading subtrees via AJAX. (It is not related to MegaMenu and similar display modules - this is an admin-only content management utility.)

When dealing with a site menu that contains thousands of links, the Backdrop Menu UI admin interface becomes so unwieldy as to be impossible to use. This module attempts to replace the all-in-one global tree view with a similar interface, but sub-trees are collapsed below a certain level, and can be expanded as needed. Drag and drop between expanded and collapsed menus is supported.

This module will not help much if your tree structure is two deep and a thousand wide. It should help a lot if your tree is half a dozen deep and a dozen wide.
